# Stacks and Queues [![](https://img.shields.io/badge/Robert-Muraru-blue)](https://robert-muraru-portfolio.herokuapp.com/)


## Description
The __stack__ is one of the most important data structures in computer science.
To understand how a stack works, think of a deck of playing cards that is face down.
We can only easily access the card that is on top.
When we want to look at the top card, there are two things we can do: we can peek at it, but leave it on the stack, or we can pop it off.
When we pop off the top object, we are taking it off the stack.
If we want to add another card to the top of the stack, we push.

In computer science, a __queue__ is a collection of entities that are maintained in a sequence and can be modified by the addition of entities at one end of the sequence and the removal of entities from the other end of the sequence. 



### [Stack](https://simple.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure))
* A stack is called a last-in-first-out (LIFO) collection. 
* This means that the last thing we added (pushed) is the first thing that gets pulled (popped) off. 
* If the last card we put on our stack of cards was an ace, then the first card we pulled from the top is that same ace.

### [Queue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Queue_(abstract_data_type))
* The operation of adding an element to the rear of the queue is known as enqueue.
* The operation of removing an element from the front is known as dequeue.
* Other operations may also be allowed, often including a peek or front operation that returns the value of the next element to be dequeued without dequeuing it.
* The operations of a queue make it a first-in-first-out (FIFO) data structure.
* In a FIFO data structure, the first element added to the queue will be the first one to be removed.
